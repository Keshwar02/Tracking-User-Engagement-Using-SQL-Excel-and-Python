# Tracking User Engagement : Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze and determine whether the new additions to the platform (new courses, exams, and career tracks) have increased student engagement between Q2 2021 and Q2 2022

- Leveraged SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from the database which was then exported as CSV files for subsequent analysis
- Examined the data distribution of key variables and addressing outliers to minimize potential skewness, and subsequently saved the cleaned datasets as CSV files for furthur analysis
- Calculated 95% confidence intervals to understand the likely range of user engagement (minutes watched) for free and paying students in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022. Additionally, hypothesis testing was conducted to evaluate if the average watch time significantly increased for both segments between these two quarters
- Calculated the correlation between minutes watched and certificates issued to find out if longer engagement means more certificates
- Determined if watching a lecture in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022 are dependent or independent events. and calculated the probability of a student watching a lecture in Q2 2021, given they watched one in Q2 2022
- Built a model to predict number of certificates issued based on the total minutes watched

## Inroduction
Welcome! This project, "Tracking User Engagement with SQL, Excel, and Python" part of the 365datascience projects, aims to analyze whether new additions(new courses, exams, and career tracks) to the platform – including enrolling in career tracks, testing knowledge through practice, course, and career track exams, and an expanded course library – have increased student engagement. By comparing different metrics, we can measure the effectiveness of these features and overall user engagement. The first half of 2022 was expected to be profitable for the company due to the hypothesized increase in student engagement following the release of these features on the website in late 2021.
