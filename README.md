# Tracking User Engagement : Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze and determine whether the new additions to the platform (new courses, exams, and career tracks) have increased student engagement between Q2 2021 and Q2 2022

- Leveraged SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from the database which was then exported as CSV files for subsequent analysis
- Examined the data distribution of key variables and addressing outliers to minimize potential skewness, and subsequently saved the cleaned datasets as CSV files for furthur analysis
- Calculated 95% confidence intervals to understand the likely range of user engagement (minutes watched) for free and paying students in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022. Additionally, hypothesis testing was conducted to evaluate if the average watch time significantly increased for both segments between these two quarters
- Calculated the correlation between minutes watched and certificates issued to find out if longer engagement means more certificates
- Determined if watching a lecture in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022 are dependent or independent events. and calculated the probability of a student watching a lecture in Q2 2021, given they watched one in Q2 2022
- Built a model to predict number of certificates issued based on the total minutes watched

## Inroduction
Welcome! This project, "Tracking User Engagement with SQL, Excel, and Python" part of the 365datascience projects, aims to analyze and determine whether new additions(new courses, exams, and career tracks) have increased student engagement between Q2 2021 and Q2 2022 â€“ new additions include enrolling in career tracks, testing knowledge through practice, course, and career track exams, and an expanded course library. By comparing different metrics, we can measure the effectiveness of these features and overall user engagement. The first half of 2022 was expected to be profitable for the company due to the hypothesized increase in student engagement following the release of these features on the website in late 2021.

## Project Requirements and Prerequisites
This project requires the following tools and software packages:

### Tools:
- `MySQL Workbench 8.0 (or later)`: Required for retrieving relevant data from the database
- `Microsoft Excel 2007 (or later)`: Required for performing hypothesis testing
- `Python 3`: Necessary for data analysis and prediction tasks

### Python Packages:
- `numpy`, `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn (optional)`: For data visualization
- `statsmodels`: For statistical modeling, and hypothesis testing
- `scikit-learn (sklearn)`: For performing linear regression and other machine learning tasks

### Cloning the Repository and Installing Python Dependencies:
1. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project
```bash
cd directory_name
```

2. Run the code below to `clone the repository`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keshwar02/Tracking-User-Engagement-Using-SQL-Excel-and-Python.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory. This is necessary so that subsequent commands(like installing dependencies) are executed within the context of the project
```bash
cd repository_name
```

4. Installing Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```

### Data:
- Execute the `initial_setup.sql` file in MySQL Workbench, which will create several tables required for our analysis. Then we write SQL queries to retrieve the specific data needed for our analysis from these tables.

## Methodology


### 1 Data Preparation with SQL
This part of the project aims to retrieve the relevant information for our analysis. This is achieved by writing SQL queries, we export the result-sets obtained as CSV files. These CSV files will be crucial for subsequent analytical tasks, such as calculating confidence intervals, performing hypothesis testing, and building a model




### 2 Data Preprocessing with Python
This part of the project aims to 

### 3 Data Analysis with Excel


### 4 Dependencies and Probabilities


### 5 Data Prediction with Python


## Conclusion
