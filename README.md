# Tracking User Engagement : Project Overview

- Leveraged SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from the database which was then exported as CSV files for subsequent analysis
- Examined the data distribution of key variables and addressing outliers to minimize potential skewness, and subsequently saved the cleaned datasets as CSV files for furthur analysis
- Calculated 95% confidence intervals to understand the likely range of user engagement (minutes watched) for free and paying students in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022. Additionally, hypothesis testing was conducted to evaluate if the average watch time significantly increased for both segments between these two quarters
- Calculated the correlation between minutes watched and certificates issued to find out if longer engagement means more certificates
- Determined if watching a lecture in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022 are dependent or independent events. and calculated the probability of a student watching a lecture in Q2 2021, given they watched one in Q2 2022
- Built a model to predict number of certificates issued based on the total minutes watched
